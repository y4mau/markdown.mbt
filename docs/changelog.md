## 2025-12-19: Unicode (non-BMP) support for Scanner

**Commits:** `a616f73`, `8d99c3a`

### Problem

Scanner used code point indices internally (`to_array()`) but `substring()` used UTF-16 indices (`unsafe_substring()`). This caused garbled output for non-BMP characters (emoji, rare CJK).

### Changes

- Add `utf16_offsets : Array[Int]?` field to Scanner for code point → UTF-16 index mapping
- `substring()`, `remaining()`, `read_line()` now correctly convert indices
- Fast detection: `source.length() != chars.length()` (O(1) instead of O(n) loop)
- Skip offset array creation when all characters are BMP

### Performance Impact

| Benchmark | Before | After | Change |
|-----------|--------|-------|--------|
| parse: small | 23.86µs | 24.25µs | **+1.6%** |
| parse: medium | 97.52µs | 100.24µs | **+2.8%** |
| parse: large | 481.37µs | 503.22µs | **+4.5%** |
| scanner: read_line 100x | 5.13µs | 6.40µs | +25% |

### Compatibility

| Character Type | Status |
|----------------|--------|
| ASCII | ✅ No change |
| BMP (Japanese, Chinese, Korean) | ✅ +2-5% overhead |
| Non-BMP (emoji) | ✅ Now works correctly |

### Tests

Added `src/unicode_test.mbt` with 64 comprehensive tests for CJK and emoji handling.

## 2025-12-17: Nested link detection

**Commit:** `24739bc`

### Changes

- Add `contains_link()` helper to detect links in inline content
- Invalidate outer link when link text contains another link (CommonMark spec)
- Recursive check includes links inside emphasis/strong/strikethrough

### CommonMark Compliance

- Tests: 202/542 (unchanged - remark uses different escaping)

### Performance Impact

| Benchmark | Before | After | Change |
|-----------|--------|-------|--------|
| parse: small | 107.29µs | 118.70µs | +10.6% |
| parse: medium | 382.11µs | 424.93µs | +11.2% |
| serialize: small | 7.42µs | 5.39µs | **-27%** |
| serialize: medium | 27.11µs | 21.99µs | **-19%** |

### Notes

Parse overhead from `contains_link()` check, but serialize improved. Net roundtrip performance is similar. Test count unchanged because remark escapes `[` and `(` in "link-like but not link" patterns, which we don't do.

## 2025-12-17: Link parser improvements

**Commit:** `ce97f69e295aad84ae8bd902a7f4bfe84a634787`

### Changes

- Add support for `(title)` style link titles (in addition to `"..."` and `'...'`)
- Allow newlines between URL and title
- Reject links with newlines in URL (both angle-bracket and bare URLs)

### CommonMark Compliance

- Tests: 201 → 202 (+1)

### Performance Impact

| Benchmark | Before | After | Change |
|-----------|--------|-------|--------|
| parse: small | 90.70µs | 107.29µs | +18% |
| parse: medium | 361.54µs | 382.11µs | +5.7% |
| serialize: small | 5.06µs | 7.42µs | +46% |
| serialize: medium | 19.70µs | 27.11µs | +38% |
| inline: links | 4.28µs | 3.99µs | **-6.8%** |

### Notes

The performance regression is primarily due to:
1. Additional newline checks in URL parsing
2. Parenthesis-style title parsing with depth tracking
3. Extended whitespace skipping (now includes newlines)

The link-specific benchmark actually improved (-6.8%), suggesting the overhead is in the general parsing path rather than link parsing itself. Accepted as reasonable tradeoff for improved CommonMark compliance.
